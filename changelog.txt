Sunday, March 19th - Chris

I filled out the remaining functions with a few changes to what Rob and I put
down. Namely, I fixed a few bugs in the Constraint and Variable classes, and
filled out CSP. CSP now stores more information - the lookup table as before
and a dict mapping values to the variable objects they are assigned to. This
is going to be necessary for backtracking search. These can be found on lines
68-79. Note this implicitely means every cell in the grid must be assigned an
index so that they can be found as needed. This should be discussed, as it
stands each variable representing in the cell has an index which is simply its
position in the array CSP.variables. 

The most glaring issue right now is that of pruning values from Variables
current domains. If we cannot do this, we can't implement forward checking or
gac. We need to think about conditions under which we can prune values.
